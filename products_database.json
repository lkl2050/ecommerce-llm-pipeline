Plus, the chassis, the battery pack, the speaker enclosure, and the power adapter all include recycled post-consumer content. And we don\u2019t stop there. The packaging is 100% plastic-free and comprised in part with rapid-renewable materials made from bamboo-sugar-cane fibre.\n\nElevated Performance & Lasting Battery\n\nThe ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 12 boasts the world\u2019s first laptop powered by Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 Ultra processors, making it ideal for creating and on-the-go productivity.
